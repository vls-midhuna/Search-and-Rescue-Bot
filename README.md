# Search-and-Rescue-Bot

## Introduction
A Search and Rescue (SAR) Robot is an autonomous or remotely controlled robotic system designed to assist in rescue missions during emergencies and disasters. These robots help locate victims, navigate hazardous environments, and provide real-time data to rescuers, improving response time and safety. Equipped with sensors like ultrasonic, gas detectors, and temperature monitors, SAR robots can detect obstacles, identify survivors, and alert rescue teams through IoT connectivity. Their ability to operate in dangerous or inaccessible areas makes them valuable tools in disaster relief operations.

## Overview
This project presents an autonomous Search and Rescue (SAR) robot designed to assist in disaster response and emergency situations. The robot is equipped with smart sensors and IoT connectivity to navigate hazardous environments, detect survivors, and provide real-time data to rescue teams. By leveraging autonomous navigation and environmental monitoring, the system enhances rescue operations, reduces risks for human responders, and improves efficiency in critical situations.

**Key Components**:
**Aries v1.0** – Core microcontroller responsible for processing sensor data and controlling navigation.
**NodeMCU (ESP8266)** – Transmits real-time data over Wi-Fi, enabling remote monitoring and alerts.
**Ultrasonic Sensors** (Front, Left, Right, Rear) – Detects obstacles and aids in autonomous navigation.
**Gas Sensor** – Identifies hazardous gases, ensuring safety in disaster-stricken areas.
**DHT11 Sensor**– Monitors temperature and humidity for environmental assessment.
**Buzzer** – Provides audible alerts for detected hazards or survivor identification.
**Chassis** – Supports movement across rough terrains, allowing the robot to operate in critical areas.

By integrating these components, the SAR robot enhances rescue efficiency, aids in survivor detection, and provides valuable real-time data, making it an essential tool for disaster management and emergency response.
